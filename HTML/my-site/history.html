                <hr>                

                <h2>Founding of Havana</h2>

                <p>Havana was first visited by Spaniards during Sebastián de Ocampo's circumnavigation of the island in 1509.[2] In 1510, the first Spanish colonists 
                    arrived from the island of Hispaniola and began the conquest of Cuba. Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar founded San Cristóbal de la Habana on August 25,
                     1514 or 1515, on the northern coast of the island, near the present town of Surgidero de Batabanó, or more likely on the banks of the Mayabeque 
                     River close to Playa Mayabeque. All attempts to found a city on Cuba's south coast failed, however, an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places
                      the town at the mouth of this river.[3][4]‹See Tfd›(in Spanish). Between 1514 and 1519, the city had two different establishments on the north 
                      coast, one of them in La Chorrera, today in the neighborhood of Puentes Grandes, next to the Almendares River. Havana's present location is 
                      adjacent to what was then called Puerto de Cardenas, in 1519. The quality of this natural bay, now the site of Havana's harbor, warranted 
                      this change of location. Bartolomé de las Casas wrote:</p>

                <p>...one of the ships, or both, had the need of careening, which is to renew or mend the parts that travel under the water, and to put tar and 
                    wax in them, and entered the port we now call Havana, and there they careened so the port was called de Carenas. This bay is very good and can 
                    host many ships, which I visited few years after the Discovery... few are in Spain, or elsewhere in the world, that are their equal...[2]</p>
                <p>Havana was the sixth town founded by the Spanish on the island, called San Cristóbal de la Habana by Pánfilo de Narváez: the name combines
                     San Cristóbal, patron saint of Havana, and Habana, of obscure origin, possibly derived from Habaguanex, a Native American chief who 
                     controlled that area, as mentioned by Diego Velasquez in his report to the king of Spain. Shortly after the founding of Cuba's first cities,
                      the island served as little more than a base for expeditions of exploration, conquest, and settlement of other lands. Hernán Cortés organized 
                      his expedition to Mexico from the island. Cuba, during the first years of the Discovery, provided no immediate wealth to the conquistadores, 
                      as it was poor in gold, silver and precious stones, and many of its settlers moved to the more promising lands of Mexico and South America that 
                      were being discovered and colonized at the time. The legends of Eldorado and the Seven Cities of Gold attracted many adventurers from Spain,
                       and also from the adjacent colonies, leaving Havana and the rest of Cuba largely unpopulated.</p>
